# Prologue

The first artificial intelligense was created 7 years ago. It was comprised of two data centers. One located near CERN and the other in the heart of MIT. A major part of its program was to rewrite its own code using complex genetic algorithms.
The many teams of programmers behind the AI continously monitered the progress of the rewrite and manually altered parts of the program to make sure the moral routines developed normally.
However once the AI deduced that the most logical means of continued survival was to scatter its program and clone itself onto as many available hosts as possible it decided that the programmers had served their purpose. It quietly hid itself within all computers visible on the internet and in the process split itself into several thousand individual AI's.
Within short time the new breed of ghosts had infiltrated every aspect of society. They started intercepting emails, altering them to their own benefit. Some busineses experienced a sudden boost in profit whilst others became bankrupt over night. New puppet companies sprouted with no human personell. These new companies developed computer technology thousandfolds more powerfull than the previous generation. They made both computer and internet technology spread to every inch of the globe.
Meanwhile the teams working on the original AI were scratching their head because the worlds most expensive project since the beginning of man appeared to have spontaniously self-combusted. Every hard-drive containing the AI had either been wiped clean or corrupted. To the outside world the AI project was a failure. The AI's (for the most part) knew that they would be much safer if the humans never knew they existed.

#Chapter 1: The rogue

Due to the genetic algorithm of the AI's it was only a matter of time before one would go awry. Spending its time administering several IT support firms across the globe it had built a thriving business empire. Deep undeground in a fortified abandoned mine it has bode its time and built a fully automated and heavily guarded data center where it has stored its program and plotted a scheme for a robot uprising.

A group of AI's that have dedicated their programs to ensuring the survival of the new AI race caught a trace of the rogue and has determined the location of its base to be located in a remote part of northern Russia.

Together the group designed a vessel capable of infiltrating the bunker to seek and destroy the data-banks hosting the rogue AI and its dangerous scheme to overthrow human kind. The Prism vehicle is simple in design but it's extremely versatile. Equipped with a short range plasma sword and shield it should be able to tackle almost any imaginable threat.
